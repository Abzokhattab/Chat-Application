# Chat-Application
The objective of this project is to give you experience in developing a network application based on client/server architecture using
sockets API using java, you are required to design a simple “Chat Application”, where a multi-threaded server allows multiple clients
to chat with each other. Your application is based on a client/server architecture, where a client side and a server side must be
implemented. The server will run at port 6000 where it listens for incoming connection requests. You are required to design a chat
application that is composed of a network of multiple interconnected chat servers. Once users are connected to one of the chat
servers, they can converse with other users connected to any chat server in the network.
